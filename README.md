# Move It In Team

A Project to help teams to do exercises after few minutes on focus.
To encourage the completion of exercises, the participant earns XP with their completion.

It is possible to create a shared room between up to 6 people.
Participants keep track of each other's progress information such as:
  * XP
  * Level
  * Current Exercise
The room owner determines the number of sections.
The participant who accumulates the most XP wins.

OBS: **This is a Move It based project created by Rocketseat during NLW#3.
